# notAVirus
this is absolutely a virus.
but a harmless one. still, use at your own risk. you might be forced to restart your computer, so make sure to save everything.

# Features as of writing this
 - Blocks Win+R, Alt+Tab, etc.
 - Creates fake screens by using screenshots overlaying over the original screens.
 - Makes process critical, which forces the user to a) shutdown gracefully before killing the process or b) cause a BSOD by using taskkill /F /IM
